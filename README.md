# STA-250-Optimization-Final
(1) Intro
  Predicted financial risk of E2006 dataset, a large-scale fifteen thousands sparse features dataset. 
  Increased testing accuracy rate from 0.79 to 0.82 by implementing ADMM for Lasso algorithm compared with Proximal Gradient algorithm and Coordinate Descent algorithm.

(2) Proximal Gradient for Lasso

(3) Coordinate Descent for Lasso

(4) ADMM for Lasso

(5) Comparison of proximal gradient, ADMM, and coordinate descent
